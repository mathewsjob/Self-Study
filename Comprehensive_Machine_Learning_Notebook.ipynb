    "# 1. Introduction to Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn from and make decisions based on data. The core idea behind ML is that instead of explicitly programming the system to perform a task, the system can learn patterns and relationships from examples or experience, improving its performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Machine Learning Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is essential in modern data-driven technologies because it allows systems to adapt, improve, and provide insights without requiring extensive human intervention. Machine learning powers technologies like recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon), autonomous vehicles, and personal assistants (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning**: \n",
    "   - The model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs). The goal is to predict the output for unseen inputs based on the learned patterns.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: Classification (identifying if an email is spam or not), Regression (predicting house prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: \n",
    "   - The model works with unlabeled data and tries to find patterns or groupings in the data.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: Clustering (grouping customers by purchasing behavior), Dimensionality Reduction (compressing data).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning**: \n",
    "   - The model interacts with an environment and learns from feedback (rewards and penalties) to optimize its actions.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: Game AI, Robot Navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: \n",
    "   - This combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data, allowing the model to benefit from both.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: Face Recognition, Website Classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Anomaly Detection**:\n",
    "   - The task is to identify rare or unusual patterns in the data, which might indicate fraud or errors.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: Credit Card Fraud Detection, Cyber Intrusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Definition**: Identify the problem to be solved and gather requirements.\n",
    "2. **Data Collection**: Collect relevant data needed for the problem.\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and prepare data for modeling.\n",
    "4. **Modeling**: Choose a machine learning algorithm and train a model on the data.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Test the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "6. **Deployment**: Use the model in a production environment to make predictions.\n",
    "7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections, we'll dive into the key types of machine learning in detail.\n"
