    "# 1. Introduction to Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn from and make decisions based on data. The core idea behind ML is that instead of explicitly programming the system to perform a task, the system can learn patterns and relationships from examples or experience, improving its performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Machine Learning Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is essential in modern data-driven technologies because it allows systems to adapt, improve, and provide insights without requiring extensive human intervention. Machine learning powers technologies like recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon), autonomous vehicles, and personal assistants (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning**: \n",
    "   - The model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs). The goal is to predict the output for unseen inputs based on the learned patterns.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: Classification (identifying if an email is spam or not), Regression (predicting house prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: \n",
    "   - The model works with unlabeled data and tries to find patterns or groupings in the data.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: Clustering (grouping customers by purchasing behavior), Dimensionality Reduction (compressing data).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning**: \n",
    "   - The model interacts with an environment and learns from feedback (rewards and penalties) to optimize its actions.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: Game AI, Robot Navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: \n",
    "   - This combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data, allowing the model to benefit from both.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: Face Recognition, Website Classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Anomaly Detection**:\n",
    "   - The task is to identify rare or unusual patterns in the data, which might indicate fraud or errors.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: Credit Card Fraud Detection, Cyber Intrusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Definition**: Identify the problem to be solved and gather requirements.\n",
    "2. **Data Collection**: Collect relevant data needed for the problem.\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and prepare data for modeling.\n",
    "4. **Modeling**: Choose a machine learning algorithm and train a model on the data.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Test the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "6. **Deployment**: Use the model in a production environment to make predictions.\n",
    "7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update as needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 2. Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that each input has a corresponding output. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs so that it can make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is broadly classified into two categories:\n",
    "1. **Classification**: The goal is to predict a discrete label or category.\n",
    "2. **Regression**: The goal is to predict a continuous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is the process of predicting the class or category of a given input based on the learned relationships from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Algorithms for Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression**: \n",
    "   - Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm. It uses the logistic function to output probabilities that can be used to classify inputs.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: \n",
    "   - KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm. It classifies a data point based on the majority class among its nearest neighbors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: \n",
    "   - SVM is a powerful classifier that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Decision Trees**: \n",
    "   - Decision trees are simple, interpretable models that recursively split the data into subgroups to predict the class of an input.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Random Forests**: \n",
    "   - Random forests are an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Neural Networks**: \n",
    "   - Neural networks are powerful models capable of handling complex classification tasks, particularly in the context of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.1 Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is used for binary classification tasks (where there are only two possible classes). It estimates the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class using the sigmoid function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\sigma(z) = \f",
    "rac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( z = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n \\). The predicted class is determined by the probability threshold (usually 0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample data\n",
    "X = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]\n",
    "y = [0, 0, 1, 1]  # Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split the data\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize and train the model\n",
    "logreg = LogisticRegression()\n",
    "logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",

    "print(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN classifies data points based on the proximity of its neighbors in the feature space. It is a lazy learning algorithm, meaning that it doesn't learn a model but stores all the training data, making predictions based on the majority vote among the K closest points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1.3 Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM works by finding a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates the data points into different classes. For two classes, it tries to maximize the margin between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the SVM classifier\n",
    "svm = SVC(kernel='linear')\n",

    "accuracy_svm = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_svm)\n",
    "print(f\"SVM Accuracy: {accuracy_svm * 100:.2f}%\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.4 Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees recursively split the data into subgroups based on feature values to predict a target class. The splits are based on the feature that provides the highest information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the Decision Tree classifier\n",
    "dt = DecisionTreeClassifier()\n",
    "dt.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict and evaluate\n",
    "y_pred_dt = dt.predict(X_test)\n",
    "accuracy_dt = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_dt)\n",
    "print(f\"Decision Tree Accuracy: {accuracy_dt * 100:.2f}%\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.5 Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data, to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n",
